Curling is a team sport, played on ice, where two teams take it in turns to slide stones 
made of granite towards a target – known as a House. It is an Olympic and Paralympic winter 
sport with medal disciplines for Women’s, Men’s, Mixed Doubles and mixed Wheelchair teams.
Traditional curling teams are made up of four players while the mixed doubles variation of 
the sport consists of teams of two players, one female and one male. In women’s, men’s and 
wheelchair curling, teams can also have a fifth player known as the Alternate – a substitute. 
Each team designates a Skip – team captain – and Vice-Skip.
